# Changelog

## 29th of July 2025, 02:15 GMT
- Added `uniqueItems` and `multipleOf` to the list of unsupported keywords in Action schemas. If you use them, you should update your actions accordingly.
- Clarified that Action schemas must have `"type": "object"`. If your schema has a different type, wrap it in an object with a property instead.

## 7th of January 2025, 12:15 GMT
- Added python script for running web-based games which can be found [here](./Web%20Game%20Runner/).
- Updated Unity SDK to 1.2.0:
  - `ActionWindow` now supports a fluent API. Additionally, `NeuroAction` no longer takes a constructor parameter of type `ActionWindow`, it is now set automatically by the SDK, so you can remove it.
  - `FormatString` is now internal, please replace it with your own implementation.
